    "- Part II: Audio control word recognition system\n",
    "- Part III: Comparison of dynamic programming with a classification method after data pre-processing by PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "For **parts II and III**, you will test the audio recognition system on two sets of voices that will serve as a learning base (references) and a test base (sounds to be recognized) respectively. The list of the 13 drone commands are: *Landing, Takeoff, Takeoff, Advance, Right turn, Backward, Left turn, Right, Flip, Left, Stop, Higher, Lower and State of Emergency.*\n",

    "To do this, you must per group of 2 students (number of students **MANDATORY**):\n",
    "1. **Propose a study** that you will detail on a report.\n",
    "For example, *influence male voices VS female voices, compare your own voices to the database, test the impact of different background noises on recognition...*];\n",

    "3. Test the DTW and a classification method with pre-processing by PCA;\n",
