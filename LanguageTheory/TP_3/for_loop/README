These parser/scanner allow to analyse the subset of these instructions:
<statlist>   ::= <stat> | <stat> ; <statlist> 
<stat>	     ::= ...| <forstat> | <affectstat>
<affectstat> ::= ident := <exp>

Variables declaration are ignored, constants are only integers, types are  not checked. The main goal is to generate quadruplets.
The lexer.mll is minimal (+ and * but neither - nor /) in order to analyse an example such as "exStatlist.c".

Very few external function calls in lang.ml 

<expr> result is a couple : name of the register and the quad list

In Ocaml (in lang.ml), there are imperative instructions ("!" and ";") to obtain the quadruplet list as a global variable.
