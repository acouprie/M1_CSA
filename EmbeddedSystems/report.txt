Exercise 2:
With only the -p option the outputs are not similar.
With only the -p -n3 option the outputs are similar.

Exercise 4:
It says:
"Always different of p[0] and p[1] in the critical section at the same time."

Exercise 5:
I added the following lines at the end of the promela file:

"ltl excl0 { [] !(p[0]@cs && p[1]@cs) }
ltl excl1 { [] !(p[0]@cs) }
ltl excl2 { [] <> (p[0]@cs || p[1]@cs) }"

Running the following command:
# ./pan -a -N excl1

Output 
"pan: ltl formula excl1
pan:1: assertion violated  !( !( !((p[0]._p==cs)))) (at depth 13)
pan: wrote promela.pml.trail"

So excl2 is violated.
